# Task 4: Invoice Deletion Functionality - Completion Report

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (100%)  
**Date**: January 6, 2025  
**Phase**: 2 - Task 4 of 5

---

## Overview

Task 4 successfully implements secure invoice deletion functionality with strict business rules aligned with FBR compliance requirements. Only draft, saved, or failed invoices can be deleted, with additional safeguards preventing deletion of FBR-submitted or validated invoices.

---

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Enhanced DELETE API Endpoint ✅

**File**: `apps/web/src/app/api/invoices/[id]/route.ts`

**Key Features**:
- Status-based deletion rules (DRAFT, SAVED, FAILED only)
- FBR submission flag checks (prevent deletion if fbrSubmitted or fbrValidated)
- Ownership verification
- Detailed error messages with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Cascade deletion of invoice items through Prisma relations

**Validation Logic**:
```typescript
// Only allow deletion of specific statuses
const deletableStatuses = ['DRAFT', 'SAVED', 'FAILED']

if (!deletableStatuses.includes(invoice.status)) {
  return NextResponse.json({ 
    error: `Cannot delete invoice with status: ${invoice.status}`,
    message: 'Only draft, saved, or failed invoices can be deleted.',
    status: invoice.status
  }, { status: 403 })
}

// Additional FBR submission checks
if (invoice.fbrSubmitted || invoice.fbrValidated) {
  return NextResponse.json({ 
    error: 'Cannot delete FBR-submitted invoice',
    message: 'This invoice has been submitted to FBR and cannot be deleted.',
    fbrSubmitted: invoice.fbrSubmitted,
    fbrValidated: invoice.fbrValidated
  }, { status: 403 })
}
```

**Response Formats**:
- **Success (200)**: `{ success: true, message: "...", deletedInvoice: {...} }`
- **Forbidden (403)**: `{ error: "...", message: "...", status: "..." }`
- **Not Found (404)**: `{ error: "Invoice not found" }`
- **Unauthorized (401)**: `{ error: "Unauthorized" }`

interface DeleteInvoiceDialogProps {
  open: boolean
  onOpenChange: (open: boolean) => void

- Cancel button
- Loading state during deletion

**Visual Design**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ⚠️  Delete Invoice                 │
│                                      │
│  Are you sure you want to delete    │
│  invoice INV-2025-001?               │

└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 4. Invoice List Page Enhancement ✅

**File**: `apps/web/src/app/invoices/page.tsx`

**Added Imports**:
```typescript
import { Trash2 } from "lucide-react"
import { DeleteInvoiceDialog } from "@/components/delete-invoice-dialog"
```

**Added State Variables**:
```typescript
const [showDeleteDialog, setShowDeleteDialog] = useState(false)
const [invoiceToDelete, setInvoiceToDelete] = useState<any>(null)
const [deleting, setDeleting] = useState(false)
```

**Added Handler Functions**:

**1. handleDeleteInvoice()** - Performs actual deletion:
```typescript
const handleDeleteInvoice = async () => {
  if (!invoiceToDelete) return

  setDeleting(true)
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/invoices/${invoiceToDelete.id}`, {
      method: 'DELETE'
    })

    const result = await response.json()

    if (response.ok) {
      // Success - reload invoice list
      await loadData()
      setShowDeleteDialog(false)
      setInvoiceToDelete(null)
      alert(result.message || 'Invoice deleted successfully')
    } else {
      // Error - show message
      alert(result.error || result.message || 'Failed to delete invoice')
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Delete error:', error)
    alert('An error occurred while deleting the invoice')
  } finally {
    setDeleting(false)
  }
}
```

**2. handleInitiateDelete(invoice)** - Validates and opens dialog:
```typescript
const handleInitiateDelete = (invoice: any) => {
  // Check if invoice can be deleted
  const deletableStatuses = ['DRAFT', 'SAVED', 'FAILED']
  
  if (!deletableStatuses.includes(invoice.status)) {
    alert(`Cannot delete invoice with status: ${invoice.status}. Only draft, saved, or failed invoices can be deleted.`)
    return
  }

  if (invoice.fbrSubmitted || invoice.fbrValidated) {
    alert('Cannot delete FBR-submitted or validated invoices.')
    return
  }

  setInvoiceToDelete(invoice)
  setShowDeleteDialog(true)
}
```

**Added UI Elements**:

**Delete Button** (in action buttons section):
```typescript
{(['DRAFT', 'SAVED', 'FAILED'].includes(invoice.status) && !invoice.fbrSubmitted) && (
  <Button 
    variant="outline" 
    size="sm"
    onClick={() => handleInitiateDelete(invoice)}
    className="text-red-600 hover:text-red-700 hover:bg-red-50"
  >
    <Trash2 className="h-4 w-4 mr-1" />
    Delete
  </Button>
)}
```

**Delete Dialog** (at bottom of page):
```typescript
{showDeleteDialog && invoiceToDelete && (
  <DeleteInvoiceDialog
    open={showDeleteDialog}
    onOpenChange={setShowDeleteDialog}
    onConfirm={handleDeleteInvoice}
    invoiceNumber={invoiceToDelete.invoiceNumber}
    status={invoiceToDelete.status}
    isDeleting={deleting}
  />
)}
```

## Business Rules & Validation

### Deletable Invoice Statuses
- ✅ **DRAFT** - Local draft invoices
- ✅ **SAVED** - Saved but not submitted
- ✅ **FAILED** - Failed FBR submissions

### Non-Deletable Invoice Statuses
- ❌ **SUBMITTED** - Currently submitted to FBR
- ❌ **VALIDATED** - FBR validated successfully
- ❌ **PUBLISHED** - Published to production
- ❌ **CANCELLED** - Already cancelled

### Additional Safeguards
- ❌ Cannot delete if `fbrSubmitted === true`
- ❌ Cannot delete if `fbrValidated === true`

---

## User Experience Flow

### Happy Path (Successful Deletion)
1. User views invoice list
2. Delete button appears only for deletable invoices (DRAFT/SAVED/FAILED)
3. User clicks Delete button
4. Confirmation dialog appears with invoice details
5. User confirms deletion
6. Invoice is deleted from database
7. Invoice list automatically refreshes
8. Success alert appears
9. Dialog closes automatically

### Error Path (Non-deletable Invoice)
1. User attempts to delete non-deletable invoice
2. Client-side validation prevents dialog from opening
3. Alert appears: "Cannot delete invoice with status: SUBMITTED. Only draft, saved, or failed invoices can be deleted."
4. No API call is made
5. Invoice remains in list

### Error Path (FBR-submitted Invoice)
1. User attempts to delete FBR-submitted invoice
2. Client-side validation prevents dialog from opening
3. Alert appears: "Cannot delete FBR-submitted or validated invoices."
4. No API call is made
5. Invoice remains in list

---

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Cascade Deletion
Prisma schema ensures invoice items are automatically deleted when invoice is deleted:

```prisma
model Invoice {
  id    String         @id @default(cuid())
  items InvoiceItem[]
  // ... other fields
}

model InvoiceItem {
  id        String  @id @default(cuid())
  invoice   Invoice @relation(fields: [invoiceId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  invoiceId String
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Error Handling Strategy
1. **Client-side validation** - Prevent invalid deletions before API call
2. **Server-side validation** - Double-check in API endpoint
3. **Detailed error messages** - Help users understand why deletion failed
4. **Graceful degradation** - Show alerts if deletion fails
5. **Automatic list refresh** - Keep UI in sync after successful deletion

---

## Security Considerations

### Ownership Verification
```typescript
// Verify user owns the business that owns the invoice
const business = await prisma.business.findFirst({
  where: { 
    id: invoice.businessId,
    user: { email: session.user.email }
  }
})

if (!business) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 })
}
```

### FBR Compliance Protection
- Prevents accidental deletion of submitted invoices
- Maintains audit trail integrity
- Protects FBR-validated data

### Soft Delete Consideration
**Current Implementation**: Hard delete (permanent removal)  
**Future Enhancement**: Consider implementing soft delete for audit purposes
