# ✅ FIXED: User Not Found Error

## 🐛 Problem
When creating a new customer, the API returned:
```
Error: User not found
```

## 🔍 Root Cause
The customer API was checking if a user exists in the database, but:
1. User might be authenticated via NextAuth session
2. User record might not exist in `users` table yet
3. Business record also didn't exist for the user

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Auth Helper Utility
**File**: `apps/web/src/lib/auth-helpers.ts`

New helper functions:
- `getAuthSession()` - Gets authenticated session or throws error
- `getOrCreateUser()` - Finds or creates user in database
- `getOrCreateBusiness()` - Finds or creates business for user
- `getAuthenticatedBusiness()` - One-call solution for APIs

### 2. Updated Customer API
**File**: `apps/web/src/app/api/customers/route.ts`

**Before**:
```typescript
const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({ email })
if (!user) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'User not found' }, { status: 404 })
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
// Automatically creates user and business if they don't exist
const business = await getAuthenticatedBusiness()
```

### 3. Updated Invoice API  
**File**: `apps/web/src/app/api/invoices/route.ts`

Applied same fix - now auto-creates user and business.

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Flow for New Users:
```
1. User logs in via NextAuth
   ↓
2. User tries to create customer
   ↓
3. API calls getAuthenticatedBusiness()
   ↓
4. Function checks: Does user exist in DB?
   → NO: Creates user record automatically
   ↓
5. Function checks: Does business exist?
   → NO: Creates default business automatically
   ↓
6. Returns business to API
   ↓
7. Customer gets created successfully!
```

### Default Business Created:
```typescript
{
  companyName: "{UserName}'s Business",
  ntnNumber: "1234567",  // User should update this
  address: "123 Business Street",
  province: "Punjab",
  businessType: "Services",
  sector: "Technology"
}
```
