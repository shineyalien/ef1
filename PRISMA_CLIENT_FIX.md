# 🔧 Prisma Client Out of Sync - Fix Required

## Problem
The running Next.js dev server has an **outdated Prisma Client** that doesn't include the new database models:
- ❌ `FBRCacheMetadata` model missing
- ❌ `FBRTransactionType` model missing  
- ❌ Other FBR lookup models may be missing

## Root Cause
When migrations are run or schema changes are made, the **Prisma Client must be regenerated**. However, if the Next.js dev server is running, it:
1. Locks the Prisma Client files
2. Continues using the old cached client
3. Doesn't pick up new models until restart

## Error Messages You're Seeing
```
Invalid `prisma.fBRCacheMetadata.findUnique()` invocation:
The table `public.fbr_cache_metadata` does not exist in the current database.
```

This is **misleading** - the table DOES exist in the database, but the Prisma Client **doesn't know about it**.

## ✅ Solution - Restart Development Server

### Step 1: Stop the Dev Server
In the terminal running `npm run dev`:
- Press `Ctrl+C` (or `Cmd+C` on Mac)
- Wait for the process to fully terminate

### Step 2: Regenerate Prisma Client
```powershell
cd "c:\Work\Vibe Coding Apss\Easy Filer\apps\web"
npx prisma generate
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✔ Generated Prisma Client
```

### Step 3: Restart Dev Server
```powershell
cd "c:\Work\Vibe Coding Apss\Easy Filer"
npm run dev
```

## 🛡️ Temporary Fix Applied (Non-Blocking Cache)

I've updated the lookup route to **gracefully handle missing models** by:

1. **Wrapped cache metadata operations in try-catch**
   - Won't crash if `FBRCacheMetadata` doesn't exist
   - Logs warnings instead of errors

2. **Made cache checks non-blocking**
   - Returns `false` on error (don't force refresh)
   - Prevents cascade failures

3. **Cache operations are now optional**
   - App continues working without cache metadata
   - Falls back to direct FBR API calls

**However, this is a TEMPORARY WORKAROUND. You still need to restart the dev server.**

## 🔍 Verification After Restart

After restarting, test these endpoints:
```
GET /api/fbr/lookup?type=transactionTypes
GET /api/fbr/lookup?type=uom&hsCode=1234
GET /api/fbr/lookup?type=provinces
```

All should work without Prisma errors.

## 📋 Why This Keeps Happening

**Prevention Tips:**
1. **Always restart dev server** after running migrations
2. **Run `npx prisma generate`** after schema changes
3. **Use `npm run dev` script** instead of manual Next.js commands (it should handle Prisma regeneration)

## Next Steps After Fix

Once the dev server is restarted:
1. ✅ Test transaction types endpoint
2. ✅ Test UoM filtering by HS code
3. ✅ Continue with Option A: Security Settings page
4. ✅ Then Option B: Tax rates deployment
5. ✅ Finally Option C: Error handling UI

**Action Required:** Please restart the development server now.
