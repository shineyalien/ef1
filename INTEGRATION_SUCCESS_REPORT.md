# Enhanced Invoice Form - Integration Success Report

## ✅ ISSUE RESOLVED: Import Path Resolution Fixed

### Problem Summary
The enhanced-invoice-form.tsx component was failing to import critical FBR integration features due to:
- Missing export statements in the FBR integration library index
- Missing TypeScript type definitions (TaxBreakdown, InvoiceItem, SROReferenceData)
- Incorrect import path resolution configuration

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Fixed FBR Integration Library Exports
**File: `libs/fbr-integration/src/index.ts`**
- ✅ Added export for `PakistaniTaxCalculator` class
- ✅ Added export for `TaxBreakdown` interface
- ✅ Added export for all FBR compliant types
- ✅ Added export for validation functions

#### 2. Added Missing Type Definitions
**File: `libs/fbr-integration/src/fbr-compliant-types.ts`**
- ✅ Added `InvoiceItem` interface for simplified usage
- ✅ Added `SROReferenceData` interface for SRO integration

**File: `libs/fbr-integration/src/tax-calculator.ts`**
- ✅ Added `TaxBreakdown` interface with complete tax structure
- ✅ Added `calculateTax()` convenience method for arrays
- ✅ Added `getSRODetails()` method for SRO integration

#### 3. Enhanced TypeScript Configuration
**File: `apps/web/tsconfig.json`**
- ✅ Added path mapping for `@/lib/fbr-integration`
- ✅ Configured proper module resolution for library imports

#### 4. Created Import Alias
**File: `apps/web/src/lib/fbr-integration.ts`**
- ✅ Created re-export file for seamless library access
- ✅ Enables clean imports with `@/lib/fbr-integration` path

#### 5. Added Missing UI Components
**File: `apps/web/src/components/ui/alert.tsx`**
- ✅ Added Alert component with proper styling variants
- ✅ Supports destructive and default alert types
