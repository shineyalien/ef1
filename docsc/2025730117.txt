5.1.   Reattempting Invoice Submission After Connection Loss  
In situations where invoice submission is interrupted due to internet connectivity issues or 
other unforeseen technical problems, it is essential to resubmit the affected invoice through 
the Digital Invoicing System. The system does not support automatic retries for failed uploads; 
therefore, the invoice must be submitted again to ensure successful transmission. 
Resubmitting the invoice helps maintain the accuracy and completeness of invoicing data, 
which is critical for compliance with tax regulations. The taxpayer can reconcile the invoices 
in their records (Invoice Dashboard) and proceed to transmit it again via invoicing system.
