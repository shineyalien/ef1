- ✅ Validates all required fields (customer, items, HS codes)
- ✅ Saves all FBR-compliant fields properly
- ✅ Calculates totals server-side
- ✅ Creates invoice with DRAFT or SAVED status
- ✅ Returns complete invoice with items and customer

#### **GET /api/invoices** (List All Invoices)
- ✅ Already working - fetches all invoices for user's business

#### **GET /api/invoices/[id]** (Get Single Invoice)
- ✅ Fetches invoice with items, customer, and business
- ✅ Verifies ownership before returning data

#### **PUT /api/invoices/[id]** (Update Invoice)
- ✅ Updates existing invoices
- ✅ Prevents editing PUBLISHED invoices
- ✅ Deletes old items and creates new ones (proper update)
- ✅ Validates all required fields

#### **DELETE /api/invoices/[id]** (Delete Invoice)
- ✅ Deletes draft/saved invoices
- ✅ Prevents deleting PUBLISHED or VALIDATED invoices
- ✅ Cascades delete to invoice items

#### **POST /api/invoices/[id]/submit** (Submit to FBR)
- ✅ Submits invoice to FBR Sandbox or Production
- ✅ Validates invoice before submission
- ✅ Checks for FBR credentials
- ✅ Requires sandbox validation before production
- ✅ Generates QR code data using FBR IRN
- ✅ Updates invoice with FBR response
- ✅ Changes status to VALIDATED (sandbox) or PUBLISHED (production)
- ✅ Currently uses mock FBR response (ready to switch to real API)

### **3. Updated Database Schema**
- ✅ Added `notes` field to Invoice model
- ✅ Added `saleType` field to InvoiceItem model
- ✅ All fields synchronized with Prisma Client
- ✅ Database migrations applied successfully

### **4. Fixed Navigation**
- ✅ Dashboard now links to `/invoices/create` (new page)
- ✅ Invoice list page links to `/invoices/create`
- ✅ Breadcrumb navigation on create page
- ✅ Back buttons work properly

## 🔄 Invoice Lifecycle (Now Working!)

```
┌──────────┐
│  DRAFT   │ ← User starts creating invoice (auto-save active)
└────┬─────┘
     │ User clicks "Save Draft"
     ▼
┌──────────┐
│  SAVED   │ ← Invoice saved, can be edited later
└────┬─────┘
     │ User clicks "Submit to FBR Sandbox"
     ▼
┌──────────┐
│SUBMITTED │ ← Awaiting FBR response
└────┬─────┘
     │ FBR validates successfully
     ▼
┌──────────┐
│VALIDATED │ ← FBR approved in sandbox
└────┬─────┘
     │ User clicks "Publish to Production"
     ▼
┌──────────┐
│PUBLISHED │ ← Final state - CANNOT BE EDITED
└──────────┘
```

## 📋 How to Test

### **1. Start the Development Server**
```powershell
cd "C:\Work\Vibe Coding Apss\Easy Filer\apps\web"
npm run dev
```

### **2. Create a New Invoice**
1. Go to Dashboard → Click "Create Invoice"
2. Or go directly to: `http://localhost:3000/invoices/create`

### **3. Test the New Features**
- ✅ Select a customer (search functionality)
- ✅ Fill in invoice details
- ✅ Add multiple line items
- ✅ See real-time tax calculations
- ✅ Wait for auto-save (watch for "Auto-saving..." indicator)
- ✅ Click "Save Draft" to save manually
- ✅ Click "Submit to FBR Sandbox" to simulate FBR submission

### **4. Verify Invoice List**
- Go to: `http://localhost:3000/invoices`
- You should see your newly created invoice
- Status should show as DRAFT, SAVED, or VALIDATED

## 🔧 What Still Needs Work (Phase 3)

### **High Priority:**
1. **Real FBR API Integration**
   - Currently using mock responses
   - Need to uncomment real API calls in `/api/invoices/[id]/submit/route.ts`
   - Add proper error handling for FBR errors

2. **Customer Creation**
   - Create customer form needs to be built
   - Currently redirects to `/customers/create` (doesn't exist yet)

3. **FBR Lookup Data**
   - Fetch real provinces, HS codes, UOM from PRAL APIs
   - Cache in database for performance
   - Currently using basic hardcoded values

4. **Edit Invoice Page**
   - Create `/invoices/[id]/edit/page.tsx`
   - Load existing invoice data
   - Prevent editing PUBLISHED invoices

5. **QR Code Generation**
   - Generate actual QR code image (currently just JSON data)
   - Display QR code on invoice view/print

6. **PDF Generation**
   - Generate printable PDF with QR code
   - Include FBR logo
   - All 26 mandatory fields

### **Medium Priority:**
7. **Bulk Invoice Import** (CSV/Excel)
8. **Offline Mode** (Service Worker + IndexedDB)
9. **Invoice Search & Filters**
10. **FBR Settings Page** (Store tokens per business)

### **Low Priority:**
11. **Dashboard Analytics** (Revenue charts, invoice counts)
12. **Email Invoices** to customers
13. **Invoice Templates** (customize layout)

## 🚨 Known Issues & Limitations

### **Current Limitations:**
1. **FBR API is Mocked**: Currently returning fake data for testing
   - To enable real FBR: Uncomment lines in `/api/invoices/[id]/submit/route.ts`
   
2. **No Customer Creation**: Customer form doesn't exist yet
   - Workaround: Create customers via API or database directly
   
3. **Limited FBR Lookup Data**: Using basic defaults
   - HS Codes: Hardcoded examples
   - UOM: Limited options
   - Tax Rates: Fixed at 18%

4. **TypeScript Strict Warnings**: Some Link href warnings
   - Code works fine, just TypeScript strict type checking

### **What Works:**
✅ Invoice creation with all fields
✅ Save as draft (auto-save + manual)
✅ Submit to sandbox (mock)
✅ Database persistence
✅ Invoice listing
✅ Navigation
✅ Tax calculations
✅ Multi-item invoices
