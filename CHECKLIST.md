## ðŸ’¡ Recommended Starting Point

**I recommend starting with Option A (Infrastructure Setup)** because:
1. âœ… Sets up the foundation for everything else
2. âœ… Allows you to test database connections
3. âœ… Required for authentication and invoice storage
4. âœ… Takes only 30-60 minutes to complete
