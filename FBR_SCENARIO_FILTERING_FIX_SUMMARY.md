# FBR Scenario Filtering Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The FBR scenario filtering was not working correctly. When users selected different business types and sectors in the business settings, the scenario dropdown was not showing the appropriate filtered scenarios. Instead, it was showing all scenarios or falling back to in-memory scenarios.

## Root Cause
The main issue was that the database tables for FBR scenario management (`fbr_scenarios` and `fbr_business_scenario_mappings`) did not exist in the database. The API was trying to query these tables but they weren't present, which caused it to fall back to the in-memory scenarios.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Database Tables
- Created SQL migration script (`packages/database/prisma/add-fbr-scenarios.sql`) to add the FBR scenario tables
- Updated the Prisma schema (`packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma`) to include the new models:
  - `FBRScenario` - Stores all FBR scenarios (SN001-SN028)
  - `FBRBusinessScenarioMapping` - Maps business types and sectors to applicable scenarios

### 2. Populated Database with FBR Scenarios
- Created a comprehensive seed script (`packages/database/prisma/fbr-scenarios-seed.ts`) that:
  - Inserts all 28 official FBR scenarios (SN001-SN028) based on FBR technical documentation
  - Creates 21 business type + sector combinations with appropriate scenario mappings
  - Ensures all combinations include essential scenarios (SN001, SN005, SN006)

### 3. Enhanced API Endpoint
- Updated the scenarios API endpoint (`apps/web/src/app/api/fbr/scenarios/route.ts`) to:
  - Query the database mapping first before falling back to in-memory scenarios
  - Include comprehensive debug logging to help with future troubleshooting
  - Validate that key scenarios are present in the returned results

### 4. Created Test Scripts
- Created test scripts to verify the scenario filtering:
  - `test-scenario-filtering.js` - Tests database queries and API logic
  - `test-all-scenarios.js` - Tests all business type + sector combinations

## Testing Results
All 21 business type + sector combinations are now working correctly:
- Manufacturing: Steel, Textile, Telecom, Petroleum, Automobile, Pharmaceuticals, FMCG, Other, Electricity Distribution, Gas Distribution
- Importer: Steel, Textile, Telecom, Automobile, Other
- Distributor: All Other Sectors
- Wholesaler: All Other Sectors
- Retailer: Wholesale / Retails
- Service Provider: All Other Sectors, CNG Stations
- Exporter: All Other Sectors

Each combination correctly returns the appropriate scenarios, including the essential ones (SN001, SN005, SN006).

## Usage Instructions
1. The FBR scenarios are now managed through the database tables
2. When users change their business type or sector in the business settings, the scenario dropdown will automatically update to show only the relevant scenarios
3. The API will log detailed information for debugging purposes (in development mode)

## Future Enhancements
1. Add an admin interface to manage FBR scenarios and mappings
2. Implement automated synchronization with FBR documentation updates
3. Add validation to ensure all mappings include essential scenarios
4. Create a UI to view and edit scenario mappings directly
