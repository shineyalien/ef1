# IndexedDB Sync Service Fixes Summary

## Issue Description
The application was experiencing IndexedDB errors in the sync service with the following error message:
```
[SyncService] Failed to get sync queue: NotFoundError: Failed to execute 'transaction' on 'IDBDatabase': One of the specified object stores was not found.
```

This error was preventing the offline synchronization functionality from working properly, which is a critical feature of the application.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by multiple inconsistencies in the IndexedDB schema across different parts of the application:

1. **Schema Mismatch**: The sync service expected a `syncQueue` object store with specific configuration, but it wasn't being created consistently
2. **Version Inconsistency**: Different parts of the codebase were using different database versions
3. **Missing Error Handling**: The sync service didn't handle cases where object stores didn't exist
4. **No Migration Strategy**: There was no system to handle database schema upgrades

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed syncQueue Object Store Configuration
**File**: `apps/web/src/lib/sync-service.ts`
- Updated the `openDB()` method to use database version 2
- Ensured `syncQueue` store is created with correct configuration: `{ keyPath: 'id' }` (without autoIncrement)
- Added proper index creation for `timestamp`, `retryCount`, and `status`

### 2. Updated Service Worker
**File**: `apps/web/public/sw.js`
- Updated all database open operations to use version 2
- Fixed the `syncQueue` store configuration to match the sync service
- Added index creation for the `status` index that was missing

### 3. Added Comprehensive Error Handling
**Files**: `apps/web/src/lib/sync-service.ts`
- Added checks for object store existence before creating transactions
- Added try-catch blocks with meaningful error messages
- Improved error handling in cleanup operations

### 4. Created Centralized Database Initialization
**New File**: `apps/web/src/lib/indexeddb-init.ts`
- Created a centralized database initialization utility
- Defined a consistent schema for all object stores
- Added helper functions for safe transaction creation
- Implemented database usage monitoring

### 5. Implemented Migration Strategy
**New File**: `apps/web/src/lib/indexeddb-migration.ts`
- Created a migration system to handle database schema upgrades
- Implemented data preservation during migrations
- Added backup and restore functionality
- Created specific migration from version 1 to version 2

### 6. Updated PWA Manager
**File**: `apps/web/src/components/pwa/pwa-manager.tsx`
- Updated to use the centralized database initialization
- Ensured consistent schema creation across the application

### 7. Created Test Page
**New File**: `apps/web/src/app/test-sync/page.tsx`
- Created a comprehensive test page for the sync service
- Added tests for all major sync operations
- Added database operation tests
- Included UI for monitoring sync status and queue

## Database Schema

### Object Stores Created:
1. **invoices** - `{ keyPath: 'id', autoIncrement: true }`
   - Index: `timestamp`

2. **customers** - `{ keyPath: 'id', autoIncrement: true }`
   - Index: `timestamp`

3. **bulkOperations** - `{ keyPath: 'id', autoIncrement: true }`
   - Index: `timestamp`

4. **syncQueue** - `{ keyPath: 'id', autoIncrement: false }`
   - Indexes: `timestamp`, `retryCount`, `status`

### Migration Path:
- **Version 1**: Initial schema with invoices, customers, and bulkOperations
- **Version 2**: Added syncQueue store with proper indexes and configuration

## Benefits of the Fixes

1. **Consistency**: All parts of the application now use the same database schema and version
2. **Reliability**: Proper error handling prevents crashes when object stores are missing
3. **Maintainability**: Centralized database initialization makes schema changes easier
4. **Data Safety**: Migration system ensures data is preserved during upgrades
5. **Debugging**: Test page provides visibility into sync operations and queue status

## How to Test

1. Navigate to `/test-sync` in the application
2. Click "Test Sync Queue" to verify basic sync operations
3. Click "Test Database Operations" to verify database functionality
4. Monitor the test results and sync queue status
5. Check browser console for any remaining errors

## Future Considerations

1. **Regular Backups**: Consider implementing automatic database backups
2. **Version Bumping**: Remember to increment the database version when making schema changes
3. **Testing**: Use the test page to verify changes after updates
4. **Monitoring**: Consider adding telemetry to monitor sync failures in production

## Files Modified

1. `apps/web/src/lib/sync-service.ts` - Updated database initialization and error handling
2. `apps/web/public/sw.js` - Updated to use consistent database version and schema
3. `apps/web/src/components/pwa/pwa-manager.tsx` - Updated to use centralized initialization

## Files Created

1. `apps/web/src/lib/indexeddb-init.ts` - Centralized database initialization
2. `apps/web/src/lib/indexeddb-migration.ts` - Database migration system
3. `apps/web/src/app/test-sync/page.tsx` - Test page for sync functionality

The IndexedDB errors in the sync service have been comprehensively fixed with proper error handling, migration support, and testing utilities.
