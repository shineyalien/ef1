### **OPTION 1: Prisma Studio** (Easiest - 2 minutes) ‚≠ê

```bash
cd "c:\Work\Vibe Coding Apss\Easy Filer"
npx prisma studio
```

Then in your browser:

**Step 1**: Edit Invoice (`INV-2025-0001`)
- `fbrInvoiceNumber`: `7000007DI1747119701593`
- `fbrSubmitted`: `true`
- `fbrValidated`: `true`  
- `submissionTimestamp`: Click "Set to now"
- Click "Save"

**Step 2**: Edit Business ("Test3 Test Business")

**Step 3**: Download PDF again

- **All features will now be visible!**

### **OPTION 2: SQL Script** (Quick)

I created a script for you:
